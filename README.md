# auto-predictability
trying to implement the auto-predictability of time series
refer from [medium - Stationarity and Memory in Financial Markets](https://medium.com/pit-ai-technologies/non-stationarity-and-memory-in-financial-markets-4b8d1200667c) and [thesis - What Makes An Asset Useful?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08444.pdf)

I also calculate efficient ratio to compare with it.

Feel free to message me if there is any advice
